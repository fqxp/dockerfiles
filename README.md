dockerfiles
===========
This repository contains Dockerfiles for building several docker images.
They should be automatically be built by the [Docker
index](https://index.docker.io). You can fetch them by using the command

    docker pull fqxp/IMAGE

after replacing `IMAGE` by a directory name from this repository.

See [my docker repository](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/fqxp/) for
build statuses of each image.

See individual `README` files in each subdirectory for descriptions
of Dockerfiles.

Always happy to receive pull requests :).

See `LICENSE` file for license these Dockerfiles are released under.
